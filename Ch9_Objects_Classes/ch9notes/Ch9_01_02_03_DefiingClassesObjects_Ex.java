/* Intro: Object-oriented programming enables you to develop large-scale software and GUIs effectively.
 * DEFINING CLASSES FOR OBJECTS:
 * A class defines the properties and behaviors for objects.
 * An object has a unique identity, state, and behavior.
 * The state of an object (also known as its properties or attributes) is represented by data fields with their current values. 
 * A circle object, for example, has a data field radius, which is the property that characterizes a circle.
 * The behavior of an object (also known as its actions) is defined by methods. To invoke a method on an object is to 
 * ask the object to perform an action. For example, you may define methods named getArea() and getPerimeter() for 
 * circle objects. 
 * 
 * Objects of the same type are defined using a common class. A class is a template, blue- print, or contract that defines 
 * what an objectâ€™s data fields and methods will be. An object is an instance of a class. 
 * You can create many instances of a class. Creating an instance is referred to as instantiation. 
 * The terms object and instance are often interchangeable. 
 * 
 * A Java class uses variables to define data fields and methods to define actions. 
 * Additionally, a class provides methods of a special type, known as constructors, which are invoked to create a 
 * new object. A constructor can perform any action, but constructors are designed to perform initializing actions, 
 * such as initializing the data fields of objects.
