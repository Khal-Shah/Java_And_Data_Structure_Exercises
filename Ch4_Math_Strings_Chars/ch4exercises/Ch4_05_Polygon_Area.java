		/* Chapter 4 - Exercise 5:
		 * (Geometry: area of a regular polygon) A regular polygon is an n-sided polygon in which all sides are of the 
		 * same length and all angles have the same degree (i.e., the polygon is both equilateral and equiangular). 
		 * The formula for computing the area of a regular polygon is Area = n s^2 / 4tan(Ï€/n)
		 * 
		 * Here, s is the length of a side. Write a program that prompts the user to enter the number of sides and their 
		 * length of a regular polygon and displays its area. 
		 * 
		 * Here is a sample run:
		 * Enter the number of sides: 5
			Enter the side: 6.5
			The area of the polygon is 74.69017017488385
