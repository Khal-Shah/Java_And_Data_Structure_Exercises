		/* (Corner point coordinates) Suppose a pentagon is centered at (0, 0) with one point at the 0 oâ€™clock position, 
		 * as shown in Figure 4.7c. Write a program that prompts the user to enter the radius of the bounding circle of a 
		 * pentagon and displays the coordinates of the five corner points on the pentagon. 
		 * 
		 * Here is a sample run:
		 * Enter the radius of the bounding circle: 100
			The coordinates of five points on the pentagon are
			(95.1057, 30.9017)
			(0.000132679, 100)
			(-95.1056, 30.9019)
			(-58.7788, -80.9015)
			(58.7782, -80.902)
