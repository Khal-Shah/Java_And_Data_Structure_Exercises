/* 9.9: DATA FIELD ENCAPSULATION
 * Making data fields private protects data and makes the class easy to maintain.
 * 
 * The data fields radius and numberOfObjects in the CircleWithStaticMembers class we saw can be modified directly 
 * (e.g., c1.radius = 5 or CircleWithStaticMembers.numberOfObjects = 10). 
 * This is not a good practiceâ€”for two reasons:
â–  First, data may be tampered with. For example, numberOfObjects is to count the number of objects created, 
but it may be mistakenly set to an arbitrary value (e.g., CircleWithStaticMembers.numberOfObjects = 10).

Second, the class becomes difficult to maintain and vulnerable to bugs. Suppose you want to modify the 
CircleWithStaticMembers class to ensure that the radius is nonnegative after other programs have already used the class. 
You have to change not only the CircleWithStaticMembers class but also the programs that use it, because the clients 
may have modified the radius directly (e.g.,c1.radius = -5).

To prevent direct modifications of data fields, you should declare the data fields private, using the private modifier. 
This is known as data field encapsulation.

A private data field cannot be accessed by an OBJECT from outside the class that defines the private field. 
However, a client often needs to retrieve and modify a data field. To make a private data field accessible, 
provide a getter method to return its value. To enable a private data field to be updated, provide a setter method to 
set a new value. A getter method is also referred to as an accessor and a setter to a mutator.
