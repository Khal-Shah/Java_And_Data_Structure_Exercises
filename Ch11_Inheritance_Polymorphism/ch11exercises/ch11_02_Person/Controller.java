/** Chapter 11 - Exercise 2:
 * (The Person, Student, Employee, Faculty, and Staff classes) Design a class named
 * Person and its two subclasses named Student and Employee. Make Faculty and Staff
 * subclasses of Employee. A person has a name, address, phone number, and email
 * address. A student has a class status (freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior).
 * Define the status as a constant. An employee has an office, salary, and date
 * hired. Use the MyDate class defined in Programming Exercise 10.14 to create
 * an object for date hired. A faculty member has office hours and a rank.
 * A staff member has a title.
 *
 * Override the toString method in each class to
 * display the class name and the personâ€™s name.
 *
 * Write a test program that creates a Person, Student, Employee, Faculty, and
 * Staff, and invokes their toString() methods.
