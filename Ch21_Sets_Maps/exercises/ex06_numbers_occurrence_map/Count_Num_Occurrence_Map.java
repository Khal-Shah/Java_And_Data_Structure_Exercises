/** Chapter 21 (Sets and Maps) - Exercise 6:
 *
 * (Count the occurrences of numbers entered) Write a program that reads an unspecified number of integers
 * and finds the one that has the most occurrences. The input ends when the input is 0.
 *
 * For example, if you entered 2 3 40 3 5 4 â€“3 3 3 2 0, the number 3 occurred most often.
 * If not one but several numbers have the most occurrences, all of them should be reported.
 * For example, since 9 and 3 appear twice in the list 9 30 3 9 3 2 4, both occurrences should be reported.
