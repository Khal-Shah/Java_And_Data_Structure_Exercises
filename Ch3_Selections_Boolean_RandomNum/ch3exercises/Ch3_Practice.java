/* Chapter 3 - Exercise 18:
 * (Cost of shipping) A shipping company uses the following function to calculate the cost (in dollars) of shipping based
 * on the weight of the package (in pounds).
 * 		Cost									Weight
 *		3.5 										0 < w <= 1
 *		5.5										1 < w <= 3
 *		8.5										3 < w <= 10
 *		10.5										10 < w <= 20
 *Write a program that prompts the user to enter the weight of the package and display the shipping cost.
 *If the weight is greater than 50, display a message “the package cannot be shipped.”
