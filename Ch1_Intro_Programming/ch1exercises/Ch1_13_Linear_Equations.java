	/* Chapter 1 - Exercise 13:
	 * (Algebra: solve 2 * 2 linear equations) You can use Cramerâ€™s rule to solve the following 2 * 2 system of 
	 * linear equation:		ax + by=e		 					x= ed - bf /ad - bc 
	 * 							     		cx + dy = f							y= af-ec /  ad - bc
	 * Write a program that solves the following equation and displays the value for x and y : 
	 * 3.4x + 50.2y = 44.5
		2.1x + .55y = 5.9
