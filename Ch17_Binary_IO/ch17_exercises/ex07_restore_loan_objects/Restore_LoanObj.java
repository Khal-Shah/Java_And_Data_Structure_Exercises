/**
 * Chapter 17 (Binary I/O) - Exercise 7:

 * (Restore objects from a file) Suppose a file named Exercise17_06.dat has
 * been created using the ObjectOutputStream from the preceding programming exercises.

 * The file contains Loan objects. The Loan class in Listing 10.2
 * does not implement Serializable. Rewrite the Loan class to implement
 * Serializable.
 *
 * Write a program that reads the Loan objects from the file and
 * displays the total loan amount. Suppose that you donâ€™t know how many Loan
 * objects are there in the file, use EOFException to end the loop
