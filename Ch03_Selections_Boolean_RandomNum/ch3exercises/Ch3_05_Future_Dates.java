	/* Chapter 3 - Exercise 5:
	 * (Find future dates) Write a program that prompts the user to enter an integer for todayâ€™s day of the week 
	 * (Sunday is 0, Monday is 1, ..., and Saturday is 6). Also prompt the user to enter the number of days after today 
	 * for a future day and display the future day of the week. Here is a sample run:
	 * Enter today's day: 1
		Enter the number of days elapsed since today: 3
		Today is Monday and the future day is Thursday
		
		Enter today's day: 0
		Enter the number of days elapsed since today: 31
		Today is Sunday and the future day is Wednesday
