		/* Chapter 4 - Exercise 4:
		 * (Geometry: area of a hexagon) The area of a hexagon can be computed using the following formula (s is the 
		 * length of a side): Area = 6s^2 / 4tan(Ï€/6)
		 * 
		 * Write a program that prompts the user to enter the side of a hexagon and displays its area. 
		 * Here is a sample run:
	
		 * Enter the side: 5.5
			The area of the hexagon is 78.59
