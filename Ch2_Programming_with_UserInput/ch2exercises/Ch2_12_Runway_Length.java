		/* Chapter 2 - Exercise 12:
		 * (Physics: finding runway length) Given an airplaneâ€™s acceleration a and take-off speed v, you can compute 
		 * the minimum runway length needed for an airplane to take off using the following formula: length = v^2 / 2a
		 * Write a program that prompts the user to enter v in meters/second (m/s) and the acceleration a in 
		 * meters/second squared (m/s2), and displays the minimum run-way length. Here is a sample run:
		 * Enter speed and acceleration: 60 3.5
			The minimum runway length for this airplane is 514.286
